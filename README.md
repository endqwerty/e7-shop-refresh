# E7 Shop Refresh

This is a Windows macro program for the game Epic Seven to go through and refresh the "Secret Shop" and purchase bookmarks for you.

Personally, I have updated this script out of personal interest in Tesseract and Epic Seven.
This provides a way for me try out image detection. This is not inteded to be a production ready application.

## Guide
I am using Python `3.9.2`, but I suspect most versions > 3.9 will work

Install requirements using
`pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

Run using
`python main.py`
